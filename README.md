# Dependecy-Inyection-Course

Exercises from the course "Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET" by Jeremy Clark. Pluralsight.

This course cover the next topic:

- Contructor injection.
- Ninject.
- Autofac.


Tight coupling makes our code hard to change and test. In this course, "Getting Started with Dependency Injection in .NET",
you will learn the foundational knowledge to break tight coupling with Dependency Injection. First, you will learn how to use 
constructor injection to create loosely-coupled code. Next, you will see how to snap those loosely-coupled pieces together 
in different ways to easily change functionality. Then, you will discover how easy it is to unit test code that uses dependency 
injection. Finally, you will explore some of the magic of dependency injection containers. When you are finished with this course, 
you will have the skills and knowledge of dependency injection needed to break tight coupling and write more maintainable code.
